__Awesome retreats__ is an attempt at curating co-working and co-living spaces for digital nomads in India. The phenomema of digital nomads is still pretty nascent in the country and there isn't an easy way for people to discover new spaces on the Internet. Since I personally believe that __being surrounded by a good community__ and __working from a remote space in a natural setting__ are hugely beneficial for boosting work productivity and maintaing work-life balance, I'm going to be primarily curating spaces which meet these two criteria. If you're a digital nomad like me or you run a co-working/co-living space in India, feel free to add more spaces to the list by filing a PR on [github](https://github.com/mb-14/awesome-retreats)!
