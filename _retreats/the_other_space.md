The Other Space, a co-working space and cafe In McLeod Ganj, is a wonderful fusion of art, food, and nature. It provides high speed internet and access to a quite room for focussed work at reasonable prices. If getting work done while sipping on hot bevareges and gazing at clouds lazily drifting across the Dhauladar ranges sounds enticing to you, I highly recommend paying a visit here. While you're there, you can also grab some food at the Illiterati Cafe next door.
