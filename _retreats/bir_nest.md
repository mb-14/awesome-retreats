Located in the village of Bir Billing, the Bir Nest hostel is a wonderful haven for digital nomads. This hostel offers a 360 degree view of Himalayan mountain ranges and lush greenery of the farmlands. Bir Nest includes a co-working space which is equipped with desks, chairs and broadband internet. I personally prefer working outside in the balcony, which is nice and breezy and offers a great view. There are spacious and clean rooms available for accommodation - both shared and private.

If you're in the mood for some adventure you can try paragliding at Bir - known worldwide - for its paragliding sessions and courses. You can also hike up to Rajgundha for an exhilarating experience in nature or visit the Gunehar village and explore the art culture present there.
